# Welcome to CONEXIONINVERSA!

I am Pedro Sánchez Cordero, author of conexioninversa.

If you have come this far, it is because you are interested in cybersecurity and more specifically in Red Team, Threath Hunting and of course, my beloved DFIR.

As you may have been able to appreciate, the old conexioninversa blog is no longer accessible, after many deliberations and nightly thoughts, I have thought that many of its contents were discontinued many years ago and in practice (today) they did not have much utility.

After that, keeping the forensic part and giving a touch incorporating "threat hunts" to the blog, I thought of creating this site with more current content.

As always, I thank you for being faithful readers of the blog that really is yours.

THANK YOU
